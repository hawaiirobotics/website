                                <p>Our journey began in the summer, calling every week to try to find a problem worth solving, that we're all passionate about, and that could be completed in the 8 months given. Our team, a diverse group of thinkers and tinkerers, united with a shared vision: to push the boundaries of robotics and AI research. We set out to explore ideas that could not only redefine technological possibilities but also offer tangible solutions to real-world challenges. Two of these were finding use cases for robotics, something we were all passionate about, and one of the problems had to do with making cooking easier - something we all wanted to solve.</p>

                                <p>Our initial concept was straightforward yet bold. We envisioned a "general purpose mobile manipulator" tailored for research labs. The core philosophy was to democratize robotics research by creating affordable, open-source platforms. This initiative aimed to accelerate embodied AI research by minimizing costs to maximize adoption, fostering a network effect through crowdsourcing data and papers.</p>

                                <p>The long term vision was to build a ubiquitous mobile manipulation platform, much like what the Franka Panda did for robot arms, but with more versatile applications. Our moonshot milestone was even more ambitious: leveraging a vast dataset to incrementally solve the complexities of general robotics, progressively venturing into more challenging and unstructured environments as AI technology advanced. Essentially riding the wave of computational intelligence with a robotics platform that was limited by intelligence, not hardware.</p>

                                <p>We acknowledged the dichotomy in the current robotics landscape: on one end, research labs struggled with expensive, clunky hardware; on the other, companies produced excellent hardware with no solid approach to embodied AI. Our solution intended to bridge this gap, providing an open-source platform rich in diverse, unlabelled data such as RGBD main camera footage, robot poses, and joint torques.</p>

                                <p>Midway through our brainstorming sessions, our attention shifted towards a more domestic application: a smart camera system for kitchen stoves, named "Sous." The problem was clear - cooking requires constant monitoring, a skill not everyone possesses. For those that suck at cooking, or can’t help being distracted, having something to watch the stove top for you is very valuable. Sous would ideally monitor cooking parameters like time, temperature, and state of food using advanced computer vision, easing the cooking process.</p>

                            <div class="text-box">
                                <p>Our short term goal was to launch a hardware product that could oversee stovetop cooking, potentially evolving to control a cooking robot. Sous was more than a gadget; it was a step towards an effortless, high-quality culinary experience, leveraging data to enhance its capabilities - and following the same theme as before of riding the intelligence wave.</p>

                                <p>As our ideas matured, we honed in on a challenge that resonated with our core competencies and aspirations: developing a teleoperation system for bimanual robots. This endeavor addresses the critical need for flexibility and precision in small-scale manufacturing environments, where manual tasks of high complexity and variability are prevalent.</p>

                                <p>To be clear, we sort’ve selected a solution ahead of a problem, but given that this field has only recently begin to grow we think this is good. So we needed to find a problem that we could solve by enabling better robot teleoperation - we settled on small scale manufacturing. Small scale manufacturing is low risk, slower, and less intense than full mass manufacturing, but could still use the advantages of modern robotics. This system would leverage cutting-edge diffusion-based imitation learning to perform precise, dexterous tasks, thus aiding small manufacturing runs and bridging the gap between prototype development and mass production.</p>
